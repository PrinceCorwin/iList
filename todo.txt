fix bug when user refreshes browser while in MyLists or NewList, the theme reverts to default (minimal) because useEffect runs on Dashboard and not in App. If I move it to App, the app is broken the first time someone opens app because user data is attempted to be fetched before a user exists...

add ability to edit list names and item descriptions
