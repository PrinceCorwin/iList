fix bug when user refreshes browser while in MyLists or NewList, the theme reverts to default (minimal) because useEffect runs on Dashboard and not in App. If I move it to App, the app is broken the first time someone opens app because user data is attempted to be fetched before a user exists...
POSSIBLE ANSWER... MOVE USEEFFECT TO APP WITH CONDITIONAL IF(USER) TO FETCH DATA. ADD USER AS DEPENDANCY? TEMP FIX: I ADDED GETUSERPREFS TO TO MYLISTS AND NEWLIST

useEffect in dashboard seems a little out of sync. getUserPrefs may run before checkIfInitialized finishes. Refactor?

Add home link to mylists and newlist

Step through all pages with quokka and refactor to prevent flashes. Make use of isLoading and <Loader> on all necessary pages pages
